"This is amazing! Also, the thing you used, frames, is exactly what I've been looking for! Gonna go research that now.
Do you have any tutorials on it?
If not, would you make one in the future?
I'm planning to use it for a website simulator, and some other things."
"3:40 I had no idea that ""birght colors"" exist! thanks :)"
"This is the exact guide I needed. However, I don't like C++ so I will stick with C and try to develop things on my own. I like Mathematics and Physics so it will be easier for me."
Hey love your content mate but will you do a tutorial for making a 3D game engine I made a 2D game engine but I just cannot find good tutorials for making a 3D engine like yours thx ❤❤
Gonna follow this but in Odin!
have you solved the problem of scaling the aspect ratio?
thank you so much! This video was very practical for me by showing exactly everything at least briefly instead of just saying them
"I enjoy your channel a lot, but I feel like most of your advice is relevant for any language, not just C++.
I understand why you personally prefer C++, but other languages are great too, and people successfully develop commercial games with them.
I tried C++ too, but I still prefer Rust, and it's growing more popular by the day."
This is exactly what i've been looking for :)
Can you give tutorials on the Pika Engine with it's modeling and C++ scripting
Would be nice to implement an npc in your minecraft clone
Ever consider starting a tutorial series where you teach C++/OpenGL? That kind of stuff really brings in an audience if the teacher is good.
Thanks comrade! Interesting to see how make load screan and progress bar
The player sprite is flipped...
"Going through a C++ book rn to catch up on all the topics I skipped as a kid. For me the hardest thing is knowing how much is enough knowledge to start with opengl. I read a whole chapter about pointers and references, watched javidx9 videos, watched the cherno, but I still cant really grasp how to use pointers or why they are in the specific sections in the code like singeltons. This is all really frustrating and feels like I will never be able."
Could you do a video on cleaning code in c++?
"Thank you so much! You explained clearly how to use your library (I wonder if it's not a tutorial for getting started with it), you explained theorical aspect of making a game before actually showing code, and that's perfect!!
_(btw im famous cuz u showed my ""hi youtube"" on da discord)_"
